## Support OLI

  <p class="oli-section__lead">OLI is building legal, scholarly, and educational capacity around a single purpose: clarifying and defending objective limits on government power and the individual rights those limits exist to protect.</p>
  <p>The Objective Law Initiative is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) public charity, and contributions are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law; while our online donation platform is being set up, prospective donors can contact us directly to coordinate contributions, including gifts by check.</p>
  <p>Lawyers, scholars, writers, editors, designers, volunteers, and prospective collaborators can also contact us about contributing time, expertise, introductions, research, writing, media, design, or other support.</p>

## What Support Makes Possible

  <p class="oli-section__lead">Support gives OLI the capacity to turn principled legal analysis into timely advocacy, public education, and institutional work.</p>
  <p>Financial and professional support helps OLI develop research, briefs, public education, editorial capacity, media assets, and the infrastructure needed to present serious legal-philosophical arguments clearly.</p>
  <p>OLI's work requires more than good ideas. It requires time, research capacity, legal judgment, writing, editing, publication tools, design, outreach, and the ability to act before important legal windows close.</p>

## Cases Do Not Wait for Infrastructure

  <p class="oli-section__lead">Major constitutional cases often reach the decisive stage before a young organization has the funding, research capacity, or briefing infrastructure to participate.</p>
  <p>By the time a case is granted, argued, or decided, the opportunity to shape the legal argument may already have passed. The matters below illustrate the kind of work OLI is built to do when it has the capacity to act: identify the principle at stake, develop an objective-law analysis, coordinate with lawyers and scholars, and intervene where a focused amicus brief or public explanation could add something other groups are not already saying.</p>

## Support Does Not Control Legal Judgment

  <p>Donors and volunteers do not control OLI's legal positions, research conclusions, advocacy judgment, publication decisions, or institutional priorities. OLI welcomes support because of its mission, not as a vehicle for private control over legal arguments.</p>
